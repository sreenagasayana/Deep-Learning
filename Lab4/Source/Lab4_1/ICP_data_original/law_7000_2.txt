Certain family court hearings to take place in public in radical trial
Family court hearings are to be held in public for the first time, in a radical trial being pursued by the leading family judge for England and Wales, the Guardian understands.
Sir James Munby, the president of the family division of the high court, is to continue far-reaching reforms to bring more transparency to the system in 2017 by launching a trial in which some types of hearings would be held in public.
It is expected appropriate orders will remain in place to protect the identities of the participants. A separate plan is being considered to allow the media access to documents from hearings that have previously been kept secret.
Women who have suffered domestic violence and experienced the family courts broke the ban on discussing their cases to reveal to the Guardian how they believe the secrecy of the system allows them to be further abused by ex-partners.
Claire Waxman, of Voice4Victims, who campaigns to highlight abuse of process within the family and civil courts, welcomed moves to increase the openness of the court system. “We would support the increase of transparency in the family courts,” she said. “We are seeing far too many victims of stalking and domestic violence being exposed to unnecessary risk and harm in these court proceedings.”
But Munby’s changes are likely to be opposed by much of the legal profession working within the family division.
